# 1. Broken Access Control

## What is Broken Access Control

<aside>
💡 Broken access control allows attackers to bypass authorization, allowing them to view sensitive data or perform tasks they aren't supposed to.

Broken access control occurs when access control in an application is improperly implemented and can be bypassed by an attacker.

Broken access control arise when users can act outside of their intended permissions. This typically leads to sensitive information disclosure, unauthorized access and modifications or destruction of data.

</aside>

## Different Types of Access Control

### Horizontal Access Control -

### Exposed Admin Panels

- Developers sometimes overlook securing sensitive functionalities like admin panels, assuming they are inaccessible due to obscurity, but attackers can find and access them using techniques like Google dorks or URL brute-forcing.
    
    Eg: https://example.com/YWRtaW4/admin.php
    
- Inconsistent access control mechanisms can lead to vulnerabilities. For example, an admin panel may require authentication for external requests but not for internal requests, leaving it vulnerable to exploitation through SSRF attacks.
- Predictable cookies or request headers can be manipulated by attackers to bypass access control. For instance, if the admin panel relies on a specific cookie value like `admin=1`, an attacker can include the same cookie in their requests to gain unauthorized access.
- Users can bypass access control points and directly access the admin panel by browsing to specific URLs.
    
    <aside>
    💡 Example
    
    Let’s say the usual way of accessing [example.com](http://example.com/)’s admin panel is
    via the URL https://example.com/YWRtaW4/admin.php. If you browse to that
    URL, you’ll be prompted to log in with your credentials. After that, you’ll
    be redirected to https://example.com/YWRtaW4/dashboard.php, which is where
    the admin panel resides.
    
    </aside>
    
- Lack of access control implementation at the dashboard page allows users to access the admin panel without credentials

### Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities

- Directory traversal vulnerabilities allow attackers to manipulate filepaths and gain unauthorized access to files.
- Attackers can use "../" sequences to escape out of restricted folders and access sensitive files.
- For example, a request like **http://example.com/upload?file=../../../../../etc/shadow** can access the /etc/shadow file containing hashed passwords.
- Attackers can crack passwords from the /etc/shadow file to gain access to privileged user accounts.
- Additionally, sensitive files such as configuration files, log files, and source code may also be accessed by exploiting directory traversal vulnerabilities.

## Hunting for Application Logic Errors and Broken Access Control

- Application logic errors and broken access control are easy bugs for beginners to find.
- Hunting for these vulnerabilities requires creative thinking and experimentation, not code tampering or malicious inputs.
- `Step 1:` Learn about the target application by browsing it as a regular user and reading its engineering blogs and documentation.
    - Example: Test newly added payment options or try accessing the default path for WordPress admin portals `(/wp-admin/admin.php)`.
- `Step 2:` Intercept requests while browsing and pay attention to sensitive functionalities.
    - Take note of how access control is implemented and how it interacts with client requests.
    - Example: Identify the requests needed to complete a payment and check if any parameters indicate payment type or amount.
- `Step 3:` Think outside the box and find ways to bypass access control or interfere with application logic.
    - Play with intercepted requests and craft requests that should not be granted.
    - Example: Modify the amount parameter to charge a lower amount or switch the payment type to a gift card without having one.
    - Example: Access the admin page by adding a special cookie, such as `admin=1.`

## Escalating the Attack

- Escalating the attack involves leveraging application logic errors and broken access control vulnerabilities.
- Combining these vulnerabilities with other weaknesses can amplify their impact.
- A broken access control vulnerability can provide unauthorized access to the admin panel, allowing for actions like console or application deployment.
- This unauthorized access may lead to remote code execution.
- By locating configuration files of a web application, an attacker can identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) specific to the software versions in use, facilitating further exploitation.
- Credentials found in a file may enable access to other machines on the network.
- The potential impact of application logic errors and broken access control vulnerabilities may not be immediately evident.
- While the impact of a vulnerability like SQL injection or stored XSS is often clear, it isn’t always apparent what attackers can achieve with application logic errors and broken access control vulnerabilities
- It is important to consider how malicious users could exploit these vulnerabilities to their fullest extent.
- Detailed communication of the impact in a report is necessary to highlight the severity and implications of these vulnerabilities.

## Prevention

- Perform thorough testing to verify the application's logic, considering both business requirements and development process.
- Review each process for logical flaws that may pose security risks.
- Implement granular access control policies on all files and actions, and audit the code for potential bypasses.
- Conduct penetration testing to identify access control vulnerabilities.
- Ensure consistent access control mechanisms across different access points, such as mobile devices, desktop devices, and API endpoints, with the same authentication requirements (e.g., MFA) for each.

## Impact of Access Control Vulnerability

- It affects CIA triad
- Can sometimes be chained with other vulnerabilities to gain RCE on the host OS

## Checklists For Identifying Broken Access Control Vulnerabilities

### 1. ****Unprotected admin functionality -****

Finding admin panel endpoint by various ways Eg: Guessing or Directory Brute forcing or Fuzzing /administrator-panel, /admin, /admin-panel, /administration etc.

### 2. Unprotected admin functionality with unpredictable URL

It's located at an unpredictable location, but the location is disclosed somewhere in the application means somewhere in the page source etc. 

### 3. User role controlled by request parameter

Try intercepting the request to the crucial endpoints like `/admin` using least privileged account and see if we can find any request parameter (admin parameter) where we could just tamper it like `isAdmin=true, admin=1, Admin=true etc.` and see if we can get a successful response like `status 200 OK` to become a privileged user.

### 4. User role can be modified in user profile

If you have 2 accounts like `1 Low privileged Account (User)` and `1 High Privileged Account (Admin)` 

After observing the `request` and `response` parameters we got to know there is a parameter called `roleid` which could be tampered to gain privilege.

Suppose the `/admin` endpoint is accessible to only that user who has the `roleid=2` Now try accessing the `/admin` endpoint with low privileged user whose `roleid` is not `2` and try to tamper the `roleid` parameter so that we can access the `/admin` endpoint.

### 5. User ID controlled by request parameter

Check whether we can see any sensitive user information of other user by tampering the `id` parameter in this case `API_KEY`

Eg: https://0a0c00fb049b53fc81f4480000ea001a.web-security-academy.net[/](https://0a0c00fb049b53fc81f4480000ea001a.web-security-academy.net/)my-account?`id=wiener`

Now try tampering the `id` parameter using burpsuite or by url tampering and change it `carlos` (any user). See if you can see any sensitive user information of user `carlos` in response.

### 6. User ID controlled by request parameter, with unpredictable user IDs

Check if we can find `unpredictable id` of users by mapping out various endpoints of application and try to tamper the `id` parameter of other users and check if we can perform horizontal privilege escalation.

Eg: https://0a0c00fb049b53fc81f4480000ea001a.web-security-academy.net/blogs?userId=c77f0e37-f9b2-420a-b602-7e75f65ae8b0

https://0a0c00fb049b53fc81f4480000ea001a.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=E77f0e37-f9E2-420a-bER2-3455f65ae8b0

### 7. User ID controlled by request parameter with data leakage in redirect

Tampering the `id` parameter > Check if you can access any of their sensitive information in the response body

Eg:  https://0a0c00fb049b53fc81f4480000ea001a.web-security-academy.net[/](https://0a0c00fb049b53fc81f4480000ea001a.web-security-academy.net/)my-account?`id=wiener`

https://0a0c00fb049b53fc81f4480000ea001a.web-security-academy.net[/](https://0a0c00fb049b53fc81f4480000ea001a.web-security-academy.net/)my-account?`id=carlos`

### 8. User ID controlled by request parameter with password disclosure

Check if we can find `administrator` or any `other users` password in the response body by tampering the `id` parameter.

### 9. Insecure direct object references

Interact with the application and check if we can download any files and check their naming scheme and check if we an tamper it or not.

Eg: https://0afd00fb049c5541803999bf004200d8.web-security-academy.net/download-transcript/`1.txt` 

https://0afd00fb049c5541803999bf004200d8.web-security-academy.net/download-transcript/`2.txt` 

### 10. URL-based access control can be circumvented

Consider a website has an unauthenticated admin panel at `/admin`, but a front-end system has been configured to block external access to that path.

Now check whether we can use `special request headers` like `X-Original-Url` or `X-Rewrite-URL` `X-Forwarded-For` `X-Forward-For` `X-Remote-IP` `X-Originating-IP` `X-Remote-Addr` `X-Client-IP`  etc. by pointing `url` to nonexistent `endpoint` & *“If the response for either request contains markers that the resource was not found, this indicates that the application supports the special request headers. These markers may include the HTTP response status code 404, or a “resource not found” message in the response body.”*

If it accepts `special request headers` then we can bypass frontend restriction imposed on a normal user account.

![image](https://i.postimg.cc/5y2vKr8J/screenshot-241.jpg){: width='1280' height='720'}

### 11. Method-based access control can be circumvented

After interacting with the application from an admin account we can get the endpoint url `/admin-roles` for upgrading users to admin group.

Try intercepting the `/admin-roles` endpoint and change the `HTTP Request Method` i.e from `POST` to `GET` or vice-versa and tamper the `id` parameter also replace the admin account `cookie` to low privileged account cookie to bypass the access control.

### 12. Multi-Step process with no access control on one step

We can check for `Multi-Step process` for eg: 3 Step Process where in access control is implemented on some of the steps but ignored on other steps.

So try to tamper the `parameters` in the request header `(id, username etc.)` along with the `cookie` of low privileged account for in between step or on the last step of the process in-order to bypass the access control.

**For Example:**

**Step 1 -**

![image](https://i.postimg.cc/yxNFCLrX/screenshot-241.jpg){: width='1280' height='720'}

**Step 2 -**

![image](https://i.postimg.cc/sgz5Vf8g/screenshot-241.jpg){: width='1280' height='720'}

**Step 3 -**

![image](https://i.postimg.cc/JzjKq2wG/screenshot-241.jpg){: width='1280' height='720'}

### 13. Referer-based access control

<aside>
💡 **Referer-based access control**

- Some websites base access controls on the `Referer` header submitted in the HTTP request. The `Referer` header is generally added to requests by browsers to indicate the page from which a request was initiated.
- For example, suppose an application robustly enforces access control over the main administrative page at `/admin`, but for sub-pages such as `/admin/deleteUser` only inspects the `Referer` header. If the `Referer` header contains the main `/admin` URL, then the request is allowed.
- In this situation, since the `Referer` header can be fully controlled by an attacker, they can forge direct requests to sensitive sub-pages, supplying the required `Referer` header, and so gain unauthorized access.

## IDOR

For example, the IDOR vulnerabilities are a common broken access control issue that applications face

A regular visitor being able to access protected pages can lead to the following:

- Being able to view sensitive information from other users
- Accessing unauthorized functionality

IDORs happen when users can access resources that do not belong to them by directly referencing the object ID, object number, or filename.

### Prevention

- Applications can prevent IDORs in two ways.
- First, the application can check the user’s identity and permissions before granting access to a resource.
- For example, the application can check if the user’s session cookies correspond to the user_id whose messages the user is requesting.
- Second, the website can use a unique, unpredictable key or a hashed identifier to reference each user’s resources.
- Hashing refers to the one-way process that transforms a value into another string.
- Hashing IDs with a secure algorithm and a secret key makes it difficult for attackers to guess the hashed ID strings.
- The best way to protect against IDORs is fine-grained access control, or a combination of access control and randomization or hashing of IDs.

### Bypassing IDOR Protection

- IDORs can be more complex than simply switching numeric IDs.
- Modern web applications use more complex ID formats to protect against IDORs.
    
    ### **Encoded IDs and Hashed IDs**
    
    - Encoded and hashed IDs should not be ignored when searching for IDORs.
        - For example, take a look at the IDs of this endpoint:
        - *https://example.com/messages?user_id=MTIzNQ*
        - *https://example.com/messages?user_id=MTIzNg*
        - These user_ids are just the base64url-encoded version of a user’s ID. MTIzNQ is the base64url-encoded string of 1235, and MTIzNg is the encoded version of 1236. Some applications use encoding schemes that you can easily reverse.
    - Common encoding schemes like base64, URL encoding, and base64url should be recognized and decoded.
    - Tools like the Smart Decode tool in Burp's decoder can be used to identify the encoding scheme *(URL encoding, HTML encoding, hex encoding, octal encoding, base64, base64url, and so
    on)*
    - If the application uses hashed or randomized IDs, check if they are predictable.
        - Sometimes applications use algorithms that produce insufficient entropy.
        - Entropy is the degree of randomness of the ID. The higher the entropy of a string, the harder it is to guess. Some IDs don’t have sufficient entropy and can be predicted after careful analysis. In this case, try creating a few accounts to analyze how these IDs are created.
        - You might be able to find a pattern that will allow you to predict IDs belonging to other users.
    - Insufficient entropy in IDs can make them predictable after careful analysis.
    - Creating multiple accounts and analyzing how IDs are created may reveal patterns to predict other users' IDs.
    
    ### **Leaked IDs**
    
    - Leaked IDs can be obtained through an API endpoint or public pages of an application.
    - An example of a leaked ID is the `conversation_id` used to retrieve detailed direct messages.
        - The request looks like this: *GET /messages?conversation_id=O1SUR7GJ43HS93VAR8xxxx*
    - The `conversation_id` appears to be secure due to its long, random, alphanumeric sequence.
    - However, it is possible to obtain a list of `conversation_ids` for a user by using their public user ID.
    - The `user_id` is publicly available on each user's profile page.
    - By obtaining a user's `user_id`, one can retrieve their list of `conversation_ids` and read their messages.
    
    ### Offer the Application an ID, Even If It Doesn’t Ask for One
    
    - Modern web applications often use cookies instead of IDs to identify user resources.
    - `Example:` Sending a GET request with a session cookie retrieves messages associated with the user.
    - Some applications may have alternative methods of retrieving resources using object IDs.
    - Adding IDs to the request can potentially reveal additional resources.
    - `Examples of adding IDs` include appending them to the URL query or POST body parameters.
    - Adding `"id," "user_id," or "message_id"` may change the application's behavior.
    - `Example`: Adding a user ID to the request may display another user's messages.
        - *GET /api_v1/messages*
        - Then maybe this request would display another user’s messages instead:
        - *GET /api_v1/messages?user_id=ANOTHER_USERS_ID*
    
    ### Keep an Eye Out for Blind IDORs
    
    - Endpoints susceptible to Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) may not directly respond with leaked information.
    - Information may be leaked elsewhere, such as in export files, emails, or text alerts.
    - An example scenario is provided where an endpoint allows users to email themselves a receipt.
        - For example, imagine that this endpoint on *example.com* allows users to email themselves a copy of a receipt:
        
        ```jsx
        POST /get_receipt
        (POST request body)
        receipt_id=3001
        ```
        
        Now, what if you were to request a receipt that belongs to another user, receipt 2983?
        
        ```jsx
        POST /get_receipt
        (POST request body)
        receipt_id=2983
        ```
        
    - By manipulating the request, it is possible to obtain receipts belonging to other users.
    - The HTTP response remains unchanged, but the leaked receipt may be received in the attacker's email inbox.
    - Malicious requests can sometimes cause information leaks at a later time.
    - The author shares an experience of discovering an IDOR that led to an information leak one month later in a monthly report.
    
    ### Change the Request Method
    
    - Different HTTP request methods can be used when one method doesn't work.
    - Common HTTP request methods include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH.
    - Some applications may have different access control implementations for each request method.
    - It is possible to exploit this by attempting different request methods on the same endpoint.
    - For example, if a GET request is not vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR), you can try using the DELETE method to remove the resource.
    - The PUT method can be used to update or create a resource at the target URL.
    - If POST requests are not successful, you can attempt to update another user's resource using the PUT method.
    - Another tactic is to switch between POST and GET requests.
    - For instance, if there is a POST request with specific parameters, it can be rewritten as a GET request with query parameters.
        
        ```jsx
        POST /get_receipt
        (POST request body)
        receipt_id=2983
        you can try rewriting it as a GET request, like this:
        GET /get_receipt?receipt_id=2983
        ```
        
    
    ### Change the Requested File Type
    
    - Changing the file type of the requested file can affect server authorization.
    - Applications may have different access controls for different methods of file reference.
    - Users can reference files using either IDs or filenames.
    - Adding the ".json" extension to the request URL can be a way to test server response.
    - The example shows a request URL with a receipt ID and then a modified URL with ".json" added
        - Try adding the .json extension to the end of the request URL and see what happens. If this request is blocked by the server
        
        ```jsx
        GET /get_receipt?receipt_id=2983
        then try this one instead:
        GET /get_receipt?receipt_id=2983.json
        ```
        
    
    ### Escalating the Attack
    
    - IDORs (Insecure Direct Object References) can have varying impact depending on the affected function.
    - Read-based IDORs leak information but don't alter the database, while write-based IDORs can modify the database without authorization.
    - Critical functionalities should be prioritized when looking for IDORs to maximize the severity of bugs.
    - Write-based IDORs in password reset, password change, and account recovery features often have high business impact.
    - Non-state-changing (read-based) IDORs should focus on functionalities that handle sensitive information like direct messages, personal information, and private content.
    - Combining IDORs with other vulnerabilities can increase their impact.
    - Examples of combinations include write-based IDOR with self-XSS forming a stored XSS, IDOR on a password reset endpoint with username enumeration leading to mass account takeover, and write IDOR on an admin account potentially resulting in RCE (Remote Code Execution).
    
    ### Automating the Attack
    
    - Automating IDOR hunting can be done using tools like Burp or custom scripts.
    - Burp intruder can be used to iterate through IDs and find valid ones.
    - The Burp extension "Autorize" scans for authorization issues by accessing higher-privileged accounts with lower-privileged accounts.
    - Burp extensions like "Auto Repeater" and "AuthMatrix" enable automation of the process of switching out cookies, headers, and parameters.
    - To access these tools, go to the Extender tab in Burp window, then navigate to the BAppStore tab to find and use the desired extension.

### Finding Your First IDOR

<aside>
💡 The best way to discover IDORs is through a source code review that checks if all direct object references are protected by access control.

</aside>

1. Create two accounts for each application role and designate one as the attacker account and the other as the victim account.
2. Discover features in the application that might lead to IDORs. Pay attention to features that return sensitive information or modify user data.
3. Revisit the features you discovered in step 2. With a proxy, intercept your browser traffic while you browse through the sensitive functionalities.
4. With a proxy, intercept each sensitive request and switch out the IDs that you see in the requests. 
5. If switching out IDs grants you access to other users’ information or lets you change their data, you might have found an IDOR.
6. Don’t despair if the application seems to be immune to IDORs. Use this opportunity to try a protection-bypass technique. If the application uses an encoded, hashed, or randomized ID, you can try decoding or predicting the IDs. You can also try supplying the application with an ID when it does not ask for one. Finally, sometimes changing the request method type or file type makes all the difference.
7. Monitor for information leaks in export files, email, and text alerts. An IDOR now might lead to an info leak in the future.
8. Draft your first IDOR report
